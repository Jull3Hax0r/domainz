## 🔍 What is this?

**D0mainz** is a command-line tool that generates realistic phishing-style domain variants from a given base domain and checks if they are available.  
Perfect for **security researchers**, **blue teams**, **bug bounty hunters**, or **brand protection audits**.

> Example: from `facebook`, D0mainz might generate:
> - `login-facebook.com`
> - `facebook-support.net`
> - `secure-facebook.xyz`  
> Then checks if those are available or already registered ✅
